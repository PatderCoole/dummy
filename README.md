# dummy

A simple Test platformer game in Unity [**2019.4.38f1**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) to learn and train the basics.
You can try out our latest release [here](https://github.com/PatderCoole/dummy/releases), but be aware this project is quite a *shitpost*.

Also you can make a fork and add some cringe to it that we might merge to our next release.
